# Donation for akx20000

Hello I am akx20000(aka Airking) from cryptocurrency community.

I am involved in several cryptocurrency projects, many are leading the newest blockchain technology.

Usually I work for Korean translations and wallet development including server resources and gui interface.

And this wouldn't work without any financial support so I've opened a small github donation page with some addresses on it.

If you would like to see what you like and make things happen, you can donate me a cup of coffee for a hard work :D.

If you have any questions about me please feel free to ask, you can contract on me via emails and slack channel.


### Donations are welcome!
